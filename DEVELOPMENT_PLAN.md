## 🔧 Git Commit Strategy

### Commit Granularity Guidelines
**Principle**: One commit per logical component - each commit should represent a complete, working piece of functionality that builds and passes tests.

#### Backend Commits (per service)
1. **Domain Layer**: 1 commit per aggregate
   - Example: `feat: Add Product aggregate with domain logic`
   - Include value objects and domain events
   - Include domain unit tests in same commit

2. **Application Layer**: 1 commit per use case group
   - Example: `feat: Add Product CQRS commands and handlers`
   - Include validators and mappings
   - Include application tests

3. **Infrastructure Layer**: 1 commit per major component
   - Example: `feat: Add Product repository with EF Core`
   - Include database configurations
   - Include integration tests

4. **API Layer**: 1 commit per controller
   - Example: `feat: Add Products API controller with endpoints`
   - Include OpenAPI documentation
   - Include controller tests

#### Frontend Commits (per feature)
1. **Setup & Configuration**: 1-2 commits for initial setup
   - Example: `feat: Initialize NextJS 15 with App Router`
   - Example: `feat: Configure Jest and React Testing Library`

2. **Components**: 1 commit per major component group
   - Example: `feat: Add authentication components with tests`
   - Include component tests
   - Include Storybook stories if applicable

3. **Pages**: 1 commit per page/route
   - Example: `feat: Add user profile page with CRUD operations`
   - Include page tests
   - Include E2E tests if applicable

4. **State Management**: 1 commit per feature slice
   - Example: `feat: Add user authentication context and hooks`
   - Include hook tests

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Testing Requirements
- ✅ Every commit MUST build successfully
- ✅ Every commit MUST have passing tests
- ✅ Every commit MUST maintain 100% coverage for touched code
- ✅ Integration tests included where applicable

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code only
- `feature/*`: Feature branches (e.g., `feature/week2-product-listing-services`)
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency production fixes
